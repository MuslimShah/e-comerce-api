Express Starter Template with MVC Pattern
This is an Express starter template that implements the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. It includes models, views, controllers, and custom error handlers to help you get started with building your web application quickly and easily.

Installation
To use this template, you can clone this repository using Git:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/express-starter-template.git
After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies using npm:

bash
Copy code
cd express-starter-template
npm install
Usage
To start the server, run the following command:

sql
Copy code
npm start
This will start the server on port 3000. You can access the server by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

MVC Pattern
The MVC pattern is a popular design pattern used in web development. It separates the application into three interconnected components: the model, the view, and the controller.

Model: Represents the data and business logic of the application.
View: Represents the user interface of the application.
Controller: Acts as an intermediary between the model and the view, handling user input and updating the model and view accordingly.
In this template, the models directory contains the database schema and models. The views directory contains the HTML templates, while the controllers directory contains the logic for handling HTTP requests and responses.

Error Handlers
Error handling is an important aspect of building robust web applications. This template includes custom error handlers to help you handle errors gracefully.

The errorHandlers directory contains custom error handlers for handling 404 and 500 errors. If a user navigates to a non-existent route, they will receive a 404 error. If there is an internal server error, they will receive a 500 error.
