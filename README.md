<h1>Express Starter Template with MVC Pattern</h1>
<p>This is an Express starter template that implements the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. It includes models, views, controllers, and custom error handlers to help you get started with building your web application quickly and easily.</p>
<p>To use this template, you can clone this repository using Git:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/MuslimShah/express-stater-template.git</code></pre>
<p>After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies using npm:</p>
<pre><code>cd express-starter-template npm install</code></pre>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To start the server, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>npm start</code></pre>
<p>This will start the server on port 3000. You can access the server by navigating to <code>http://localhost:3000</code> in your web browser.</p>

<h2>MVC Pattern</h2>
<p>The MVC pattern is a popular design pattern used in web development. It separates the application into three interconnected components: the model, the view, and the controller.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Model:</strong> Represents the data and business logic of the application.</li>
	<li><strong>View:</strong> Represents the user interface of the application.</li>
	<li><strong>Controller:</strong> Acts as an intermediary between the model and the view, handling user input and updating the model and view accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this template, the <code>models</code> directory contains the database schema and models. The <code>views</code> directory contains the HTML templates, while the <code>controllers</code> directory contains the logic for handling HTTP requests and responses.</p>

<h2>Error Handlers</h2>
<p>Error handling is an important aspect of building robust web applications. This template includes custom error handlers to help you handle errors gracefully.</p>
<p>The <code>errorHandlers</code> directory contains custom error handlers for handling 404 and 500 errors. If a user navigates to a non-existent route, they will receive a 404 error. If there is an internal server error, they will receive a 500 error.</p>
